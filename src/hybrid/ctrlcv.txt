When "Your Version" (Hierarchical) is Better:

This version is generally more robust and likely to perform better on hard, complex puzzles with deep search trees.

Better Load Balancing: Its key strength. For difficult puzzles where the solving time for different branches varies wildly, having many small tasks allows the OpenMP runtime to dynamically distribute work and prevent threads from sitting idle. This is crucial for achieving good scalability as you increase the thread count.

Scalability: It is better suited for higher thread counts (e.g., 8, 16, 32 threads) because it generates enough parallel work to keep all of them busy.

Irregular Problems: If the puzzle has a very irregular search space, this model adapts more gracefully.

The main drawback is the higher overhead of generating work units a second time. For very easy puzzles, this overhead might be greater than the time saved by parallelization.

When the "Alt Version" (First-Move) is Better:

This version is simpler and can be faster for easy puzzles or puzzles with solutions near the top of the search tree.

Low Overhead: It gets to the actual backtracking search much faster because it doesn't spend time on a second layer of work decomposition.

Good Enough for Simple Cases: If the search space is fairly uniform or a solution is found quickly, the potential load imbalance is less of an issue.

Low Thread Counts: If you are only using 2 or 4 threads, creating a few large tasks might be perfectly sufficient to get a good speedup without the extra complexity.

The main drawback is the risk of severe load imbalance. In a worst-case scenario, the thread that picks the correct first move will do almost all the work, while the other threads finish their (incorrect) paths quickly and then wait, nearly nullifying the benefit of parallelism.
